# Clean Coding

A standalone Codex plugin containing the `clean-development` skill for implementing features, fixing bugs, and refactoring with minimal complexity and evidence-backed verification.

## Choose your setup

| What you want | Install |
| --- | --- |
| Implementation, fixes, and refactoring only | [Clean Coding](https://github.com/wgtechlabs/clean-coding) (`clean-development`) |
| Code and pull-request reviews only | [Clean Code Review](https://github.com/wgtechlabs/clean-code-review) (`clean-code-review`) |
| Both skills plus task routing and Git/delivery conventions | [Clean Workflow](https://github.com/wgtechlabs/clean-workflow) |

Clean Workflow bundles both skills, so users of the full workflow do not need
to install the standalone plugins as well. Each standalone plugin works without
Clean Workflow and follows the user's existing project instructions. You can
also install both standalone plugins if you want both skills without the workflow.

For the full bundle, use the installation instructions in the
[Clean Workflow README](https://github.com/wgtechlabs/clean-workflow#install-for-codex).

## Install this standalone plugin

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add wgtechlabs/clean-coding
codex plugin add clean-coding@clean-coding
```

Start a new chat after installation and invoke `$clean-development`.
Agents supporting the Agent Skills format can load `skills/clean-development/` directly.

## Scope

The skill covers clarification, implementation, relevant UI design and polish, verification, and maintainability review. It is self-contained and requires no other skills. Repository access and task-specific development tools are still needed.

Repository instructions and user requests remain authoritative. Installing this skill does not authorize publishing, merging, or deploying changes.

## Attribution

Extracted from [Clean Workflow](https://github.com/wgtechlabs/clean-workflow). The skill includes its source lineage and the Codelynx article that inspired the workflow.

## Contributing

This repository is the canonical source for `clean-development`. Make changes to this
skill here; Clean Workflow consumes released updates as reviewed downstream
imports. The bundle can lag behind the standalone release until its update PR
is reviewed and merged.

Use short-lived feature branches from `dev`, squash merge feature PRs into `dev`, and promote `dev` to `main` with a regular merge commit. Follow [Clean Commit](https://github.com/wgtechlabs/clean-commit) message conventions.

## Releases

Pushes to `main` run [Release Build Flow](https://github.com/wgtechlabs/release-build-flow-action).
The workflow plans a SemVer release from Clean Commit history, updates the plugin
manifest, then commits it with the changelog before creating the tag and GitHub Release.
The initial release is `0.1.0`. No release runs on `dev`.

The workflow uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `contents: write`; no PAT secret
is required. Branch rules must allow its release commit. Token-generated pushes
do not trigger another release run. After a release, sync `main` back into `dev`
to retain generated version and changelog changes.
